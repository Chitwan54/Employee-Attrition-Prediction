# Employee-Attrition-Prediction

Problem Statement:
Employee attrition refers to the percentage of workers who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees. A high rate of attrition in an organization leads to increased recruitment, hiring and training costs. Not only it is costly, but qualified and competent replacements are hard to find. In this project, an attempt has been made to predict the Employee Attrition using Classification Techniques.

The Repository consists of the following:
1) Jupyter Notebook (.pynb)
2) README.md file
